TODO:
-- Give opportunity-volunteer match priority based on volunteer preference (if easily doable)
-- Constrain availability data to be comma separated
-- Check that data validation is moderately comprehensive
-- Double-check solution requirements
-- Double-check Github contains all needed files (and no extraneous ones)
-- Figure out how database will be implemented-local? Server?
